# ðŸ§  TensorFlow Practice

This repository contains my practice and learning progress on TensorFlow â€” a powerful open-source library for building and training deep learning models. The focus is on understanding concepts from scratch and implementing them through small practice projects and examples.

âœ… **Covered Topics**

### ðŸ“˜ Tensors & Basics
- Creating tensors using `tf.constant()` and `tf.Variable()`
- Tensor shapes, ranks, and data types
- Indexing and slicing tensors
- Type casting and reshaping

### ðŸ“— Operations & Math
- Basic arithmetic operations on tensors
- Element-wise and matrix multiplication
- Broadcasting rules
- Aggregation functions: `reduce_sum()`, `reduce_mean()`, etc.

### ðŸ“™ Model Building (Sequential API)
- Defining models using `tf.keras.Sequential`
- Adding layers: `Dense`, `Flatten`, `Dropout`, etc.
- Compiling models: loss, optimizer, metrics
- Fitting and evaluating models

### ðŸ“• Training Workflow
- Epochs, batches, and history object
- Validation data and overfitting handling

ðŸ§  **Upcoming Topics**
- Functional API and subclassing models
- Custom loss functions and metrics
- Model saving/loading (`.h5`, SavedModel)
- Callbacks: EarlyStopping, ModelCheckpoint
- TensorBoard for visualization
